– it ' s a race for the governor ' s mansion in 11 states today , and the gop could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states . the gop currently controls 29 of the country ' s top state offices ; it ' s expected to keep the three republican ones that are up for grabs ( utah , north dakota , and indiana ) , and wrest north carolina from the dems . that brings its toll to 30 , with the potential to take three more , reports npr . races in montana , new hampshire , and washington are still too close to call , and in all three , democrat incumbents aren ' t seeking reelection . the results could have a big impact on health care , since a supreme court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of obamacare ' s medicaid expansion . " a romney victory would dramatically empower republican governors , " said one analyst . click for npr ' s state-by-state breakdown of what could happen .
– it turns out facebook is only guilty of about half of what it ’ s been accused of in the gay kiss incident . the social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in ” event in london . “the photo in question does not violate our statement of rights and responsibilities , and was removed in error , ” the site said in a statement , according to the advocate . but facebook did not , as has been reported in several places , take down the kiss-in event itself . here ’ s what happened : the photo facebook took down was posted by the dangerous minds blog to promote the event . in its initial write-up about the incident , the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down . but it was actually the organizer himself who " removed " the event , dangerous minds clarified . organizer paul shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one , as " there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it .

– not a big fan of southern california ? neither is northern california , apparently . supervisors in rural siskiyou county voted 4-1 tuesday in favor of seceding from the state , reports the times-standard . the county thinks state officials in sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own — to be called jefferson . supporters want to invite other northern counties , and perhaps a few from oregon , to join , too , notes the los angeles times . ” we have to have government that ' s local , understands our issues , and has empathy , ” says one local rancher . it ' s clearly a very long-shot bid , one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the us congress . still , neighboring humboldt county is expected to meet soon to consider the idea . ( meanwhile , some counties in colorado want to form a new state of their own. )
– why did microsoft buy nokia ' s phone business ? we now know microsoft ' s answer : the computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve microsoft ' s margins on windows phones , which will allow it to invest more in the platform , which will accelerate sales and market share growth , the washington post reports . but john herrman at buzzfeed has another explanation : " fear of dying alone . " here ' s what he and other pundits are saying : the presentation " manages to sound both insane and uninspiring , outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic , " herman argues — like capturing a whole 15 % of the smartphone market . " it ' s a fitting end for the close of microsoft ' s ballmer era , during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades " while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways . like everyone , microsoft is trying to ape the apple model , mobileopportunity observes . but it ' s not so sure that ' s a good idea . " there already is an apple , " the blog points out , and other software/hardware hybrid companies , like palm and blackberry , have been crushed under its heel . maybe microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its os . the move risks complicating microsoft ' s crucial relationships with other pc and device manufacturers , one analyst tells zdnet . but he adds that " microsoft needed to make a bold move " or face " certain terminal decline , " and that the price it paid for nokia " seems extremely reasonable . " meanwhile , matthew yglesias at slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from nokia ceo ( and , perhaps , microsoft heir apparent ) stephen elop , in which he uses the story of a deepwater horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform — a seemingly desperate , yet necessary move — to explain the company ' s shift from its own failed os to windows phone . of course , yglesias notes , that move " was basically a total failure .
