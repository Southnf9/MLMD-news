– education secretary john king has a message for states where physical discipline is permitted in schools , per usa today : quit it . in a letter to governors and state school chiefs , king says 22 states — mostly in the south and west — still allow corporal punishment or don ' t forbid it . he implores them to stop the " harmful " and " ineffective " practice , saying it teaches kids that getting physical is ok to solve problems . he also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings . about 80 groups — including the naacp — lent their support to a similar letter penned monday by the national women ' s law center , reports cbs news . " corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities , and it ' s time we do the same for our nation ' s schoolchildren , " an nwlc rep says . king also notes that physical punishment isn ' t applied equitably to all students . for example , even though black students make up about 16 % of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools , they ' re on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment . boys are subjected to 80 % of such acts , while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students . " these data and disparities shock the conscience , " king writes . ( alabama paddled 19k students in one school year. )
– a massive leak of fracking fluid poured into the streets of arlington , texas , two months ago and forced the evacuation of a hundred homes . now city officials have taken vantage energy to task for its " unacceptable " handling of the 43,000-gallon spill , wfaa reports . during a city council meeting yesterday , it emerged that vantage had taken nearly two hours to call 911 despite the risk of a gas leak .

" it could have ended in a bad outcome . two hours ’ advance notice could have helped a lot . " still , officials say the environmental damage was not extensive and vantage has been cooperative . so what happened , exactly ? according to the city ' s report , a vantage well site sprung a leak on april 11 , which allowed fracking water and chemicals to boil up into arlington ' s streets , storm sewers , and streams . because the fracking fluid had been fracturing shale and freeing gas under high pressure , natural gas could have leaked at any time . now wfaa says a 1,500-gallon spill occurred at the same location a month before , and nbc-dallas/fort worth reports that the site is close to reopening . " i just assumed this was a residential area and it would be free from industrial hazardous operations , " says a resident after hearing about the earlier spill . " now we see it ' s not . "
