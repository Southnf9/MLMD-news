– the da vinci code has sold so many copies — that would be at least 80 million — that it ' s bound to turn up in book donation piles . but at one charity shop in the uk , it ' s been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of da vinci code copies that reads : " you could give us another da vinci code ... but we would rather have your vinyl ! " the manager of the oxfam shop in swansea tells the telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display : " i would say that we get one copy of the book every day . " he says people buy them " occasionally , " but with vinyl sales up 25 % in the past year , they ' d rather take records . dan brown ' s book isn ' t the only one that shops like oxfam struggle to re-sell . last year , oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of fifty shades of grey , and it similarly begged donors : " please — no more . " but brown has a particular kind of staying power . the da vinci code was published in 2003 , and within six years brown had booted john grisham from the no . 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to oxfam ' s 700 shops , reported the guardian at the time . the independent in 2012 reported brown ' s best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running .

– don juan de oñate sought a city of gold when he explored what are now the plains states . it wasn ' t to be , but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602 , they did find something staggering : a " great settlement " some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people , an ancestral wichita indian town called etzanoa . but french explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people , sowing confusion among latter-day historians . donald blakeslee , an archaeologist with wichita state university , says he ' s cleared it all up : etzanoa did exist , he claims , once thriving where the walnut and arkansas rivers meet in arkansas city , kansas . per a university press release , things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old spanish documents by the university of california , berkeley ' s cibola project . prior translation errors caused " many archaeological discoveries in the area [ to be ] misinterpreted , " per the release . in 2015 , blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined . and , indeed , a search there turned up small iron cannon balls , reported the kansas city star at the time . if blakeslee is right , the " long-lost city " would be second only to cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric native american sites , reports the wichita eagle . that would be a boon for arkansas city and its 12,000 residents ; some 400,000 flock to the remains of cahokia , in illinois , each year . the kansas house of representatives thinks blakeslee is onto something ; earlier this month it approved a resolution that formally recognizes etzanoa based on " the evidence , " reports the courier traveler .

– an augmented reality startup is being sued for sex discrimination by the very female executive it hired to make it less of a " boy ' s club , " the guardian reports . when tannen campbell was hired by magic leap in 2015 , the florida company had no women in leadership roles and its only idea to make its product female-friendly was to release a pink version , according to forbes . the lawsuit filed by campbell following her firing in december describes a " macho bullying atmosphere , " business insider reports . that allegedly includes tolerating sexist and offensive behavior , such as telling new hires to stay away from " orientals , old people , and ovaries " and having the only female character in a centerpiece app " on her knees grovelling at the heroes . " furthermore , campbell alleges her efforts to change the culture at magic leap were consistently thwarted . the lawsuit states campbell was asked to put together a presentation on the lack of gender diversity at the company , but it took seven months for magic leap ' s chief executive to show up for the presentation , and he left in the middle of it . campbell says she and other female employees were ignored when giving input on the design of the product and its marketing . the lawsuit , which also alleges a hostile work environment and retaliation , claims the sexist culture at magic leap created a " dysfunctional " workplace and is part of the reason the company has yet to actually release a product despite being valued at billions of dollars .
– the length of a man ' s index and ring fingers have recently been linked from everything to promiscuity and how nice he is to women . the idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero , and it ' s known as the " 2d : 4d " ratio . a lower ratio — where the second digit is shorter than the fourth — indicates " greater androgen exposure . " in the journal clinical anatomy , researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia ; they take that one step further , hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males . then they set out to test that hypothesis : in their small study , researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls . they found " significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands , " the researchers report in a press release . the findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum : the right-hand 2d : 4d ratio was " significantly higher " among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was " significantly lower " — suggesting the two are opposites , perhaps because testosterone " affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain , " per the study . as for those ratios , the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients . ( a recent study found that schizophrenia isn ' t actually one disease. )
